prelude: >
    This release puppet-keystone no longer deploys keystone with separated
    ports (admin and public as they were called in v2.0). By default keystone
    will only listen to port 5000, you need to make sure all your services are
    configured to use the correct port to talk to keystone.
features:
  - |
    Added new parameter keystone::federation::openidc::keystone_url that can be
    used to set the keystone url for federation, if not provided it will use
    keystone::public_endpoint.
upgrade:
  - |
    Keystone is now deployed with only port 5000, you can change this with
    keystone::wsgi::apache::api_port, you need to make sure all your services are
    configured to talk to keystone on this port. If you want to keep backward
    compatibility with port 35357 you should pass an array to api_port with
    both port 35357 and 5000.
  - |
    The providers has been updated to read DEFAULT/public_port which defaults
    to 5000 and use that port to talk to Keystone when managing resources.
    You need to make sure that keystone::public_port and keystone::wsgi::apache::api_port
    is set to the same value if you are deploying keystone with Apache WSGI.
  - |
    keystone::federation::mellon is now added to Keystone WSGI for port 5000 by
    default and admin_port and main_port parameters does not do anything and is
    deprecated.
  - |
    keystone::federation::shibboleth is now added to Keystone WSGI for port 5000
    by default and admin_port and main_port parameters does not do anything and is
    deprecated.
  - |
    keystone::federation::openidc is now added to Keystone WSGI for port 5000
    by default and admin_port and main_port parameters does not do anything and is
    deprecated.
  - |
    keystone::federation::openidc::keystone_url parameter has been added to give the
    keystone endpoint, if it's not provided keystone::public_endpoint will be used.
    We recommend that you set this since keystone::public_endpoint might be deprecated
    in a future release.
